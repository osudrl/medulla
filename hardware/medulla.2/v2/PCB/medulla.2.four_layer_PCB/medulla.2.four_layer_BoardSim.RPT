|               -> pin's signal level exceeded the power-supply rail |
|                  by more than the net's overshoot threshold        |
|           O = Signal-integrity-overshoot error                     |

|                  level by more than the net's overshoot threshold  |
|           M = Multi-threshold-crossing error                       |
|               -> pin's signal level crossed the threshold more     |
|                  than once during transition                       |
|           N = Non-monotonic error                                  |
|               -> pin's signal level changed direction while within |
|                  the transition region between Vil and Vih         |
|           X = Crosstalk error                                      |
|               -> crosstalk from neighbor nets exceeded the         |
|                  threshold value for this net                      |
|           - = No error in this field                               |

| Note:   Metal delays shown in this report are copper delays only   |
|         (no effects of reflections, IC loading, etc.) For actual   |
|         pin-to-pin delays, see detailed SI simulation results.     |
